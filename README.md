Disclaimer for when TensorBoard for TensorFlow.js is released:

"Why did you make this when TensorBoard already exists, and it's so much better?"
"I made this before TensorBoard for TensorFlow.js was released. Also, (at least for now), TensorBoard can't be used to edit data graphs, but only visualize them."
